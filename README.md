### Render a text into a pixel area

This program uses the freetype library to render a character in a given font into a 28x28 pixel area. Here an example on the usage:

```
> ./renderText "/Library/Fonts/Comic Sans MS.ttf" z text
                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
  .***********

}
```

The program requires the freetype library to be installed on your machine. Here are the steps for MacOS:

```
brew install freetype-dev freetype
```

Adjust the location of the freetype library on your system in the Makefile before compiling with 'make'.
